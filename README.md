##Insight Data Engineering coding challenge

No special libraries used.

Here are the requirements:
sys, os, collections, re, time, heapq, datetime

There is only one executable file:

process_log.py

It processes the entire input file. Features are implemented as methods named feature_1(), feature_2() etc for easy reference.

Thank you
